# Task_1House-Price-Prediction-with-Linear-Regression
This project aims to create a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features using the linear regression algorithm. Linear regression is a fundamental technique in the field of machine learning and is particularly useful for predicting continuous target variables, making it an ideal choice for predicting house prices.
