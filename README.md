# Task_1House-Price-Prediction-with-Linear-Regression
This project aims to create a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features using the linear regression algorithm. Linear regression is a fundamental technique in the field of machine learning and is particularly useful for predicting continuous target variables, making it an ideal choice for predicting house prices.
**Dataset**
We have used a dataset containing information about various houses, including features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, and more. This dataset is used to train and evaluate our linear regression model.

**Model Building**
Our machine learning pipeline includes the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: We clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features as required.
Model Selection: We choose linear regression as our predictive model due to its simplicity and interpretability. It's well-suited for this regression task.
Training: We split the dataset into training and testing sets, then train the linear regression model on the training data.
Evaluation: We assess the model's performance using various evaluation metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) to gauge its accuracy and effectiveness.
Prediction: We use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

**Usage**
You can easily replicate our project by following the code and instructions provided in the repository. This project is a great starting point for anyone interested in understanding linear regression and building a simple yet effective house price prediction model.
